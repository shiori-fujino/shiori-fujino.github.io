    <div class="blog__content">
        <p>1st Generation - walk the streets and pick up on the corner</p>
<p>2nd Generation - Internet</p>
<p>I was one of the beneficiaries of the 2nd generation sex worker industry. In the 2nd wave, consumers could share their experiences and thoughts with many more people through the magic of the internet (forums). Communicating with them through the discussion board and hanging out via social media worked great for me. Guys are always thirsty for not only nude-selfie, but also companionship.<br>
No longer bound by &ldquo;words of mouth&rdquo;, or &ldquo;receptionist recommendation&rdquo;. I can directly chat with punters, read my after-report, hang out with the guys. Parlour Instagram account that is filled with girls' half-naked pics. 1st generation was almost like Russian roulette!</p>
<p>3rd Generation - Amazon/Taobao/Alibaba/eBay</p>
<p>Now you all the options are at the tips of your fingers. Reviews, Pictures, Videos, Pricing, Private, Escort, Brothel, Japanese, MMF, Korean&hellip;. list goes on.
There exists an uncountable amounts of escort websites that you can compare price and services (sounds like amazon), dating apps, what about Only-fans and THOTs?</p>
<p>In this ever evolving 3rd generation of the sex industry, consumers may not even have to go see a worker physically. Get a Virtual Reality goggle and try Porn-hub&rsquo;s VR section. I know it&rsquo;s not the same. Although this represents a fundamental generation shift, There&rsquo;s a fact that never changes over the century, millennium: Men are horny and men get lonely, and they will find a way to satisfy their sexual thirst that can only be quenched by pussy.</p>
<p>So is the easier access the better for business or consumer. I believe the increase in information will make brothels pick up their game. No longer can they hid their flaws when people openly review their girls and rooms. It&rsquo;ll create more transparency, room for improvement and ultimately the consumers will be the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Sydney is full of legal brothel, and private sex market is rampant. Spoiled for choice to work. Girls move around from shop to shop depending on what they feel like.
Comparing (girls) in this industry is almost meaningless. Because girls act differently at different shops.
At A-shop they might be a total bitch. But at B-shop they might be saints.</p>
<p>In the past we didn&rsquo;t really need to compete. Put up a sign and guys lined up outside.
Now the supply and demand curve inverted. More options and more awareness. Brothels need to step up their game.
Why some establishments have consistently good girls and never a girl waiting. Always fucking. And some just seem to spiral down the toilet.</p>
<p>What brings punters to shops?
Seasonal discount, coupons and vouchers?
Through a subscribed newsletter system?
Not using fake photos and not asking favoured reviews of girls?</p>
<p>Other shops can do these too. Besides, I want a long-lasting campaign rather than Xmas $20.00 off coupon or NYE $30.00 off voucher.</p>
<p>This is what I think
If you have the best product, but no marketing. You have no business.
Except we&rsquo;re No5, an OG in the industry and well known. So to excel we have to have a product and experience that&rsquo;s better and constantly improving.</p>
<p>That n5m goal for 2021. Raise our standards in terms of girls, attitude and give you punters a run for your cash. In a period with no trips overseas and no holidays. Let us be your get away.</p>
