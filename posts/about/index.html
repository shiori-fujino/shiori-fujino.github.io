        <p>This notepad is made after many fails of other blog set-ups and many other failures in my life.</p>
<p>I had a blog that I used to write about sex, relationship and other personal issues. I ran for about 5 years and had to close it because I couldn&rsquo;t handle too much attention. I started it to get attention, and I succeeded it. But it was too much for me.</p>
<p>Over half a year, I was locked-in psychward twice. I saw and heard things that never exist. I am still in recovery, I take meds from now and then. Although, I thought it would be good to write again to rehab faster. People have to do something that they like to do. That&rsquo;s what life is all about. Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If you read this now, then you must be one of my long-time follower, or&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how you get to here. This site is not SEO friendly, either reader-friendly website. I only write things to avoid &ldquo;I-have-no-motivation-at-all&rdquo; state.
I think it&rsquo;s from meds that I take. These meds are pretty shit; With a bit of exaggeration, I am human-vegetable these days. I put on quite a lot of weight, and I hate this the most. I never worried about getting fat, but it&rsquo;s now very real.</p>
<p>This is all about. Are you still reading?</p>
