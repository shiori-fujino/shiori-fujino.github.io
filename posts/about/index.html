<meta name="description" content="I have been working in the sex industry for years now. I am happy to share my experience because not many people can write about this questionable subject even though many are curious. I would go even further and expect changes in public attitude toward sex workers and industry people. I want to be a writer with great insight into sex and relationship, I might as well explore more about my mental issues too." />

        <p>This notepad is made after many fails of other blog set-ups and many other failures in my life.</p>
<p>I had a blog that I used to write about sex, relationship and other personal issues. I ran for about 5 years and had to close it because I couldn&rsquo;t handle too much attention. This blog won&rsquo;t even have a comment section, we can&rsquo;t troll here anymore.</p>
<p>Over half a year, I was locked-in psychward twice. I am still in recovery, I take meds from now and then. Although, I thought it would be good to write again to rehab faster. People have to do something that they like to do. That&rsquo;s what life is all about. Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If you read this now, then you must be one of my long-time follower, or&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how you get to here. This page is not SEO friendly, either reader-friendly website. I only write things to avoid &ldquo;I-have-no-motivation-at-all&rdquo; state these days.</p>
<p>This is all about. Are you still reading?</p>
