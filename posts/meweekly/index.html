        <p>My car was broken down twice in a week.
Finally, joined Yoga again. Last week I rode twice and swim(splash) once. But I know losing weight is all about diet. I don&rsquo;t know how meds slow metabolism but wish It&rsquo;s over soon?</p>

<p>I slept whole day on Wednesday again. I mean 24 hours. I woke up and ate something twice and slept again.
