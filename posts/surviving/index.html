        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s from meds or my messed-up lifestyle, my face is covered by acne. It&rsquo;s depressing to look in the mirror. Things are changing in no time. Before the breakdown, I spent my days in front of a mirror or taking a selfie.</p>
<p>I started to eat junk food. I even had 2 hash browns in a row the other day. Plus, Domino&rsquo;s puff pastry is back. It&rsquo;s a shame not many people like this gourmet food. If you are reading this, please investigate peri-peri chicken with puff pastry from Domino. The pastry is not as rich or buttery as a croissant, but it has its own delicate pie-like texture. Having Mcdonald or Domino was an annual occasion for me. Earlier, I knew this diet will pimple me and fat me. Ohh, I drink coke too these days. I never drank any carbonated drinks except kombucha in my entire life, until very recently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this in my bed. Although last few years I barely stayed in bed, or at home. Life was full of experiences and situations. Most of the time, I was in love with someone: I used to date numerous guys when I was a sex worker. I mean, A LOT. Colleagues and boss were not happy about me seeing customers outside of the shop for free. Some of them accused me of I was degrading job title. I didn&rsquo;t need money. Rather, I craved the feeling of &ldquo;wanted&rdquo;. (I still am, who doesn&rsquo;t?) I was always thirty for guys' sprunting. Obviously, no relationship was ended well.</p>
<p>If not in love, I was oversea or interstate for more adventure-time: Travelling was the easiest way to escape reality. I tried my best to find something that stimulates me. I often threw myself into unusual circumstances, so I could experience catharsis by solving obstacles.</p>
<p>Monday, Wednesday and Friday I went gym, other days I did pilates and yoga: The toned body was everything. Someone must have to applaud or worship me; otherwise, I was an empty shell. I have never done exercise for being healthy, All I wanted was praise.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I did a blog: After I stopped working as a service provider, I needed alternative attention feed to cover my urge. I made my first blog, and I&rsquo;ve hit the big time there. I met uncountable fanboys through the blog, and I comforted myself with more than enough attention.</p>
<p>There was no time for boredom. Life wearied me sometimes, but it was full of fun.</p>
<p>Current work has been giving me some slack since they consider my mental issue as no joke. Work has been slow since covid anyway, There are almost zero new girls to promote. Moreover, thanks to Paliperidone, I seem to suffer from anhedonia. Nothing excites me anymore, everything no longer appears to be necessary. Experiencing new things no more thrills me. Who cares whether I&rsquo;m worthwhile or worthless anymore? I no longer seek anyone&rsquo;s validation; I just can&rsquo;t be fucked. I even wore the same t-shirt for 3 days in a row. I am less annoyed by pants size and blemishes. It is what it is ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>This is actually a great feeling somehow. Paliperidone gave me eternal lethargy and fatigue, but it brought absolute peace of mind as well. Life got so much easier, but I started to get bored instead. I began to wonder if it&rsquo;s how ordinary people live their life.</p>
<p>I am learning to be completely alone. I was comfortable when someone gives me consistent interest and attention right next to me. It seems eerie when there&rsquo;s no one. I just couldn&rsquo;t stand it. I even started to sleep at work because I&rsquo;m sick of sleeping/waking up alone in silence, lonely.</p>
<p>I started seeing a guy. He was a friend of mine for many years. We stay together without talking about many things. I did me he did him though I still felt connected. We know each other too well, so there was no excitement, but I felt the safest when I was with him. I thought that I finally settle for good(classic). We talked about the future like many other couples do. He often kissed me while I was asleep, and that was my favourite part.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s too cool for a relationship though, I thought I know him well, but he decided to act like he&rsquo;s a totally new person one day somehow. I won&rsquo;t let other guys sleep in my bedroom when I&rsquo;m in relationship. Especially, the other guy is someone who I used to cuddle. He let her stay in his room, so I left him. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they did something or didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just too pissed about the fact that he lets her stay in his room. Another heartbroken story, We know the patterns. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I only date dickheads.</p>
<p>Ahh, life.</p>
