				<p>It&rsquo;s been half a year after I wrote <a href="/posts/medjournal1/">Medication journal (1)</a> and the medication still is wearing off. I, at last, started the magic day of the month for the first time in 6 months, but I still lactate only ever so slightly when I squeeze my blueberries hard enough.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon watching a documentary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and tv series<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> about trauma recently. It&rsquo;s a huge progress that I could finish an hour of documentary film and 10 episodes of tv series. When I just got the Invega, I hardly ever was interested in anything. Books, movies, songs&hellip; literally nothing. I&rsquo;m a little shy to say this but these days, I like Justin Bieber&rsquo;s song. lol &ldquo;Peaches&rdquo; is beautiful.</p>

<p>I start to focus on strange things (I&rsquo;m seeing numbers like 747, 777, 797) and maybe subtly delusional but ok, I prefer being a psycho to a numb-brainer.</p>
<p>I wrote numerous times about my issues and problems previously, so you&rsquo;d know well how messed up I am if you&rsquo;ve been following my blogs, but let me briefly demonstrate me again: Broken family, Seeking approval, Codependent relationships, Low self-esteem, therefore lack of self-love, and so on&hellip; Like everyone else, my life stuck in snowballed trauma. Everyone lives with trauma in their piggyback. Some might be raised in a broken family, some got bullied in school, some has been rejected by many people, some might always sense the worthlessness, some might have been through everything above like me.</p>
<p>Working as a sex worker definitely cured some problems<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> by getting enough daily dose of attention and praises(that I never had in my entire life). Seeing various types of people naked and observe them widen my perspective about life. I always had too much in my head. Someday I decided to write all those mingled thoughts deep inside of me and It helped a lot. It made me realise what the great cause of all problems was. It’s ok if I can’t change what happened in the past, at least I know where it comes from when I’m about to lose my sanity. So&hellip; there are at least 2 things that I think I&rsquo;ve accomplished in my life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, professional help, especially pharmaceutical help wasn&rsquo;t helpful at all. I get it, the world needs more doctors and nurses to treat sick people but we only have limited time and material so… meds are easier for everyone. But it won&rsquo;t work for everyone. I wish I knew what Paliperodone, or Seroquel can do to me. I figured too late but I hope someone can get a clue from what I write. If a doctor prescribes you paliperidone(Invega), run, run fast until they can’t find you!!! There are several posts on Reddit about paliperidone(Invega) so you might check that out too. I don’t know, my advice from my own experience not going to work for everyone, and some people have to take meds no matter what. If you do or don&rsquo;t, the best advice from me: Hang in there, days are coming.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost been a year since I became a qualified psycho. Life goes on. I’ll write meds journal (3) when I can stop taking Seroquel<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, so when I am an entirely drug-free person.</p>
