    <div class="blog__content">
        <p>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed, and 90 minutes of limited internet access time.</p>
<p>I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, I stopped seeing or hearing things. I was a zombie either a pig I&rsquo;d say. I had only two senses left after Olanzapine. 1. I&rsquo;m hungry, and 2. I&rsquo;m sleepy. I had many other problems such as edema, weight gain(obviously), blurred vision, drooling, and so on. I complained a lot, and the doctor changed Olanzapine to Seroquel.</p>
<p>Seroquel was greater. I slept 8 hours max, and I lost all the weight I put on from Olanzapine. I survived with Seroquel for about six months, and the second psychosis episode happened. The hospital put me into Paliperidone this time. It sounded reasonable enough. The dose is administered by needle, it slowly releases and lasts a month up to three months in my body. I didn&rsquo;t have to have Seroquel every night anymore. But this was the beginning of the tragedy.</p>
<p>I never knew. I never care about withdraw symptoms of Seroquel. Where do I begin?</p>
<p>I never knew that people usually taper down/off dose to minimise withdrawal symptoms. I went cold turkey though because with Paliperidone+Seroquel combination I couldn&rsquo;t live the life. Both meds make people stop thinking and fall asleep. I could sleep 20 hours a day again, but I have to pay bills simultaneously. So I cut off Seroquel 100mg to 0 without consulting with the psychiatrist.</p>
<p>The withdrawal was REAL. The biggest problem was nausea. I couldn&rsquo;t sit up for more than 5 minutes. I couldn&rsquo;t look at a monitor, phone, book for more than 10 minutes. I felt sick straight after. Lay down only helped me. I couldn&rsquo;t eat days and nights because everything smelled disgusting. I puked and had diarrhea followed by. I thought I would lose so much weight and die eventually, but Paliperidone didn&rsquo;t let me.</p>
<p>Olanzapine&rsquo;s side effects(zombie effect) are nothing compare to Paliperidone&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t lose much weight even though I barely ate. I&rsquo;m not able to continue the conversation because I have nothing in my head. I don&rsquo;t understand songs, movies and books. Nothing seems interesting or exciting. Brain shrank. Everything gets very boring, and nothing stimulates me. It&rsquo;s hard to explain how I feel right now because I&rsquo;m not creative anymore. I have a hard time to organise thoughts and express them. I don&rsquo;t want to do anything—literally nothing. I am bed-ridden for the whole day. I enjoyed riding my motorbike before, but now I&rsquo;m afraid of riding, I&rsquo;m scared of falling asleep or losing focus for a second while riding. The things that I enjoyed before: swimming, adventures, even being a troll, became the least inspiring thing in the world. My life was much delightful before Paliperidone.</p>
<p>There are many things that I can&rsquo;t just explain with some English vocabulary, but simply put it this way: this is not a way to live my life. I was crazy but creative and active. Another day I didn&rsquo;t even want to have a shower. It&rsquo;s very basic human needs, but I had to encourage myself, even force myself to have a shower. Can you believe this is happening now?</p>
<p>I want my maniac back(not schizo though). People could think that I&rsquo;m much calm and reasonable. But this is not me. I was a trouble maker, but I had something inside me. I wanted to be an environmental campaigner, a writer, a good worker, a nice girlfriend. I always wanted to be prettier, and now I don&rsquo;t even remember when was the last time I wore make-up. I forgot to mention that I am producing mother milk nowadays. Although I&rsquo;m not pregnant, and there&rsquo;s no possibility. When I found the word &ldquo;lactation&rdquo; from the side-effect list, I expected a little leak or drip kind of amount. Guess what. I can squirt like a super soaker. I&rsquo;m making it a lot, and my boobs are twice giant. I want my small, manageable, handful boobs back.</p>
<p>If it were orally-taken pill like Olanzapine, I&rsquo;d have stopped taking it from the beginning. I can&rsquo;t do anything right now but waiting until the effects of the medication wear off itself. The last injection was 12/01/21, and it supposes to last a month in the system. I&rsquo;m vaporising meds every single second while I&rsquo;m breathing. I&rsquo;m surviving.</p>
<p>It is not an overstatement to say that this blog is made because of all drugs that I had.  I&rsquo;m furious. I have to share this because It shouldn&rsquo;t be only me who&rsquo;s desperate because of meds. I feel like my mind is trapped in my foggy brain. I had so many voices, but now I have nothing. I&rsquo;m more like human right activist now. A human shouldn&rsquo;t be treated with Paliperidone or Olanzapine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I try to write something. The only way I could be motivated. I already feel much better than last few weeks. It&rsquo;s wearing off! One day I&rsquo;ll get better, One day I could go for Wentworth falls again, one day I could enjoy riding motorbike again, but now I want to go back to the time when I had smart. I miss smart. I miss the time when I could have a sandwich while driving. Having a car plus motorbike is different from having a motorbike ONLY. I ride because there&rsquo;s no other option, fuck!</p>
<p>My previous blog was full of sexual contents include my nudes, F word, and many other bad stuff. I didn&rsquo;t know I have so many things to write without being overly-sexual. What the fuck?</p>
