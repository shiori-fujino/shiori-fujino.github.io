				<p>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.</p>
<p>I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl <em>ugly</em> only because she&rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&hellip; is it ok to describe a human as <em>ugly</em>?</p>
<p>Some people might think it&rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged. Their body-type, face structure, height, weight and boobs size should be gauged, measured, graded and finally judged by public because at the end of the day girls are just products that you can buy for an hour or 30 minutes. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound apocalyptic and morally corrupted? It sounds like modern slavery to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s acceptable when customer complains about girl&rsquo;s service and skills, because customers pay for their service not for girl itself as a product.</p>
<p>It was punter-planet. Under my review, people were talking about my tattoos and a random guy commented: &ldquo;yuck! I hate tattoos&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can skip booking without hurting anyone with tattoo. People become way expressive, judgmental with keyboard. People should acknowledge that there are some snowflakes (yes das me) get hurt because someone who I never met in real life hates me. You didn&rsquo;t even pay me but hate me why</p>
<p>Ugly is very offensive word especially when it comes to your very own business. Your reckless comment &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ugly.&rdquo;, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s old&rdquo; can ruin a girl&rsquo;s business. That&rsquo;s why I fought with <strong>Lenka_x5</strong> and <strong>hayabi666</strong> like a crazy feminist. They made malicious reviews of girls with bad intention, hoping that it ruins girl&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok to think and feel &ldquo;oh she&rsquo;s ugly&rdquo; and maybe still okayy to talk to your friends about it.</p>
<p>Publishing your <em>highly subjective point of view</em> that can possibly ruin someone&rsquo;s income because who cares, it&rsquo;s internet and nobody will know who you are&hellip; is not ok. We have the right to express what we think and feel, but there are less spiteful ways. You could simply just say</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not my type.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find her attractive.&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Can you shout aloud &ldquo;You are ugly&rdquo; to random person&rsquo;s face? Maybe you can if you are dumb and rude enough, most people can&rsquo;t, and we all don&rsquo;t. But why so mean when you are behind of monitor?</p>
<p>Star is my current favourite girl. She works hard, down to earth, so cute when she laughs, most importantly She&rsquo;s too funny to chat with. I cried while laughing last night when she spoke about an elderly man who harassed her in some weird ways. Furthermore, She is not old at all. My age is relatively younger in full service market and She&rsquo;s much younger than me.</p>
<p>It is not okay to call someone as ugly even in real life, out of the sex industry. Beauty is subjective, there are many other words to describe people&rsquo;s appearance. For example I was called as this dinosaur when I was little. It&rsquo;s not beautiful creature but it&rsquo;s not ugly either. Maybe it is, I find it cute though&hellip;</p>
