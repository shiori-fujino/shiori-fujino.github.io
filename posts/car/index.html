        <p>Previously, I was lucky to drive and ride a European brand car and motorbike. They were even brand new; therefore, I couldn&rsquo;t find any discomfort while driving and riding. I had way more than I deserve.</p>
<p>I returned the car, sold the bike, and I&rsquo;m back to 0. Since I sold my bike to peanut price, I needed to buy a peanut price car. There were not many options. Many peanut-priced cars are sold for parts only, registration is expired, or something is missing or doesn&rsquo;t work properly due to all of those reasons. One car, fortunately, caught my eyesâ€”Daihatsu charade 1991. It&rsquo;s 30 years old car, and I was surprised that it&rsquo;s still working. Inside and outside, both are cleaner than my previous one, and that&rsquo;s enough. It shivers like crazy when it&rsquo;s waiting for traffic lights or turn on the aircon, the steering wheel is mad stiff, and the right side speaker doesn&rsquo;t work, but it&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s wheeling. Bluetooth? What&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p>No more excuses like &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t have a car&hellip;&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be going somewhere, even grocery shopping, when I have spare time. Resolving the &ldquo;dead inside&rdquo;, &ldquo;no motivation&rdquo; state step by step&hellip;</p>
