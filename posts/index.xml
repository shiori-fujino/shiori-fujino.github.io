      <description>Indonesian girl Angel made a lot of chips from.. cassava-like root veggie, and We all liked it. If you know cassava, It has its notable bitterness ever so slightly, it&amp;rsquo;s less savoury than potato, and unlike sweet potato, it&amp;rsquo;s not sweet at all. It&amp;rsquo;s just more-ish, you can&amp;rsquo;t stop making sound kajak-kajak-kajak-kajak-. Once a girl introduce their food, and it gets popular, there must be a bulk-buying scene. Everyone orders a pack or two each and get excited together.</description>

      <description>Previously, I was lucky to drive and ride a European brand car and motorbike. They were even brand new; therefore, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any discomfort while driving and riding. I had way more than I deserve.
I returned the car, sold the bike, and I&amp;rsquo;m back to 0. Since I sold my bike to peanut price, I needed to buy a peanut price car. There were not many options. Many peanut-priced cars are sold for parts only, registration is expired, or something is missing or doesn&amp;rsquo;t work properly due to all of those reasons.</description>

      <description>Try to write something when my mood is ok.
I rode my bike four more days without knowing that registration got expired. It reminds me of the glorious smart car and $1500 penalty for driving an unregistered vehicle. Rather, I was missing its good old days.
I&amp;rsquo;m harking back to my past the most these days. I look up google location history(it&amp;rsquo;s spookily accurate, have a look yours if you have time), I stare at 70GB iCloud albums filled with food, night out, people, places, and many more things.</description>

      <description>I thought Invega sustenna (paliperidone injection) would last for a month, but I sleep much more than last week. Last week I thought meds finally start wearing off. I was a bit more buoyant, more motivated, but it all came back to &amp;ldquo;empty-inside&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;dead-inside&amp;rdquo; phase since yesterday. I still lactate a lot, and today I slept for almost 20 hours. I asked work to give me some more tasks, I think I need something to do.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s from meds or my messed-up lifestyle, my face is covered by acne. It&amp;rsquo;s depressing to look in the mirror. Things are changing in no time. Before the breakdown, I spent my days in front of a mirror or taking a selfie.
I started to eat junk food. I even had 2 hash browns in a row the other day. Plus, Domino&amp;rsquo;s puff pastry is back. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame not many people like this gourmet food.</description>

      <description>I had few goals to achieve before 2020 ends.
 Fix computers: I edited some system files (I only remember sudoer.d) from my desktop and laptop and now I can&amp;rsquo;t use it at all. I went to Apple store today, though they can&amp;rsquo;t help me either because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a proof of purchase(receipt)&amp;hellip; Get motorbike checked up: Dashboard says to get serviced since December. Make a new blog  I wanted to build a new blog from the time when I closed my previous one.</description>

      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed, and 90 minutes of limited internet access time.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>

      <description>1st Generation - walk the streets and pick up on the corner
2nd Generation - Internet
I was one of the beneficiaries of the 2nd generation sex worker industry. In the 2nd wave, consumers could share their experiences and thoughts with many more people through the magic of the internet (forums). Communicating with them through the discussion board and hanging out via social media worked great for me. Guys are always thirsty for not only nude-selfie, but also companionship.</description>

      <description>Hi
I am nobody, I work at No.5 as management. These days I do everything. I advertise, clean offices, help other staff, deliver food for girls, write thisâ€¦ But I used to be a working girl too.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it and done it all, so not much surprises me these days. But when I first started, I used to be curious about this industry. Is it like in the movies, prostitution are run by gangsters.</description>

      <description>This notepad is made after many fails of other blog set-ups and many other failures in my life.
I had a blog that I used to write about sex, relationship and other personal issues. I ran for about 5 years and had to close it because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle too much attention. This blog won&amp;rsquo;t even have a comment section, we can&amp;rsquo;t troll here anymore.
Over half a year, I was locked-in psychward twice.</description>
