      <description>I just finished bootcamp in a Mongolian town.
   Have you ever seen Mongol Shop
   Mongol foods (and kimchi?)
   Mongol desserts
   Mongol&amp;hellip; fried dough?
   Mongol coffee (?)
   Mongol bags
   My choice: Mongol cake that is made of cream cheese, condensed milk, and possibly&amp;hellip; oreo powder?
As I mentioned in the previous post, I wasn’t Celine’s exclusive booker this time.</description>

      <description>Hi,
I am currently working at a brothel as a management. I do everything. I advertise, clean offices, help other staff, deliver food for girls, take picture of girls, write this… But I used to be a working girl, service provider too.
I’ve seen it and done it all, so not much surprises me these days. But when I first started, I used to be curious about this industry. Is it like in the movies?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of girls&#39; pictures and I have reached a conclusion that selfies can be more attractive than photos that were taken by another person, when it comes to sex worker&amp;rsquo;s profile pictures.
Of course, hiring a professional with a proper setting is different. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we use the same iPhone X as our only equipment.
   This, can&amp;rsquo;t be any worse. Apart from anything (cloth, shoes, angle, lighting etc) She just looks so awkward.</description>

      <description>Things you can do(other than sex) during lockdown
Buy OneWheel and ride Send me an invitation on Animal Crossing I remember same time of last year, It was lockdown stage 4 though people were horny as usual. Maybe even hornier than ever. Restriction made people crazy, nothing to do so better have sex! Guys looked for sex workers even during WW2 so… don’t worry too much about having blueballs, If there’s a will, there’s a way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been half a year after I wrote Medication journal (1) and the medication still is wearing off. I, at last, started the magic day of the month for the first time in 6 months, but I still lactate only ever so slightly when I squeeze my blueberries hard enough.
I stumbled upon watching a documentary1 and tv series2 about trauma recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge progress that I could finish an hour of documentary film and 10 episodes of tv series.</description>

      <description>City ride from Darling harbour through Barangaroo to Rocks and Circular quay. Fun 🤩
      Written in Korean 느지막이 일어나 세수도 안하고 마차 크로쌍 사러 갔다가 나간김에 장도 봐가지고 왔다. 주말 오후 쇼핑몰 졸라 싫음. ㅋㅋ 크로와상 정말이지 너무 맛있어 💕💓
   외로워서 죽을것 같은 시간에는 개미 한마리 없다가 혼자라도 재밌게 잘 살 수 있어 라고 마음이 조금 단단해 지면 그때 꼭 어디서 슬금슬금 기어들 나오더라 그럼 나는 또 맥도 못추고 사랑에 빠졌다.</description>

      <description>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope it’s only a coincidence.
 No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do. No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.
   Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>

      <description>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&amp;rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&amp;rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&amp;hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&amp;rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.</description>

      <description>Sex worker market 1st Generation - Walk the streets and pick up on the corner
2nd Generation - Internet
I was one of the beneficiaries of the 2nd generation sex worker industry. In the 2nd wave, consumers could share their experiences and thoughts with many more people through the magic of the internet (forums). Communicating with them through the discussion board and hanging out via social media worked great for me.</description>

      <description>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &amp;ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.</description>

      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed. Very very smol bed.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, but I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>
