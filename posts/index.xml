      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been half a year after I wrote Medication journal (1) and the medication still is wearing off. I, at last, started the magic day of the month for the first time in 6 months, but I still lactate only ever so slightly when I squeeze my blueberries hard enough.
I stumbled upon watching a documentary1 and tv series2 about trauma recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge progress that I could finish an hour of documentary film and 10 episodes of tv series.</description>

      <description>City ride from Darling harbour through Barangaroo to Rocks and Circular quay. Fun 🤩
      Written in Korean 느지막이 일어나 세수도 안하고 마차 크로쌍 사러 갔다가 나간김에 장도 봐가지고 왔다. 주말 오후 쇼핑몰 졸라 싫음. ㅋㅋ 크로와상 정말이지 너무 맛있어 💕💓
   외로워서 죽을것 같은 시간에는 개미 한마리 없다가 혼자라도 재밌게 잘 살 수 있어 라고 마음이 조금 단단해 지면 그때 꼭 어디서 슬금슬금 기어들 나오더라 그럼 나는 또 맥도 못추고 사랑에 빠졌다.</description>

      <description>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope it’s only a coincidence.
 No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do. No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.
   Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>

      <description>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&amp;rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&amp;rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&amp;hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&amp;rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.</description>

      <description>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &amp;ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.</description>

      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed. Very very smol bed.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, but I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>
