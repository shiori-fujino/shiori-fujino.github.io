				<p>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write. I mentioned too many times previously that I never got praised until I did blowjob and blog. lol Two big things in my life.</p>
<p>I bought Onewheel for my self birthday present. I&rsquo;ve been riding a week straight and it&rsquo;s lot of fun. I fell, rolled, flew, face-pancaked uncountable times. I got bruise all over my body and even on my face, now I&rsquo;m a bit scared. Before, I was fearless because I didn&rsquo;t know how painful it is until I really injure myself. With a little tiny bit of fear I ride more cautiously. It&rsquo;s natural, it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want that pain again. Dating a guy is like that too. I met numerous guys without awe in last 10 years, heart was broken many times and I am not begging for relationship anymore, I&rsquo;m preventing myself from any more injuries. Actually, everything is like that, You can do things without fear when you don&rsquo;t know about things very well. It&rsquo;s good that I am more cautious now but sometimes I miss fearless myself. I was more brave.</p>
<p>New night receptionist is same age as me and he has 3 jobs. I asked him &ldquo;why you work so hard?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;to save money and to buy a house&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s shocking, maybe because I never thought that way.</p>
