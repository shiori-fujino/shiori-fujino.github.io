<p>Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol</p>

Spicy Taste - Mala and skews</p>
<p>Tried once and never again:</p>
<p>Bare witness, Pado poke, Scissors and tongs and many more, but I can&rsquo;t think of any right now. Been Auver&rsquo;s many times too only because it&rsquo;s convenient. Matcha croissant was superb I remember, other food were not so remarkable.</p>
<p>Whenever I be the most voluble critic of Rhodes eats, people rather question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why many working girls live in Rhodes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well&hellip; I don&rsquo;t fucking know. For me I thought I will be jogging/cycling every morning along the river. Maybe It gave me a bit of Gangnam vibe too. Near river, parks, super cars, clean, modern, newer apartments&hellip; I have stayed in City, Marrickville(hip), Gladesville(quiet), Strathfield(Korea), Lidcombe(Another Korea) and Rhodes by far the best for me. I like here.</p>
<p>I can roughly guess though, Korean working girls have not many options when they choose where to live. Most of them have to share with other people and other people must be Korean, at least they prefer to live with Korean. And many Koreans live in Rhodes.</p>
<p>Strathfield, Lidcombe, Eastwood are more well known <em>Kolonised</em> suburbs but Kgirls don&rsquo;t want to live there because they might bump into customers and that&rsquo;s awkward? I acknowledge that the majority of customers in K-massage places and Karaokes are Korean men.</p>
<p>Then why many Koreans choose to live in Rhodes? I think it&rsquo;s same as why Chinese choose to live in Rhodes? It has big mall which has almost everything, train station, some might work here or near by&hellip; and also living near river always good fung-shui you know.</p>
<p>Is fung-shui the reason why many privates/escorts/agencies operate in Rhodes?</p>
<p>I think there are some important factors that we could consider when we choose place for naughty-works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Accessibility:  Near train station, easy to find a parking, near from customer’s office, or their home. We found Rhodes is great because it suits to everything. Some live in Rhodes, some work in Rhodes. Some can ride bicycle from Parramatta, maybe use train from City after work, or just knock the next door because girl and customer are literally in same apartment. It&rsquo;s not too difficult to visit from any suburbs in Sydney metro area.</li>
<li>Availability: Some of luxury city/river view apartments in Rhodes are more expensive than rooms in City, but we still choose Rhodes because almost every CBD apartments have security guards at the entry of building. Intercom availability is crucial as well as washing machine and drier. If intercom can&rsquo;t open the main door with a button, that means you have to go down and pick up customers every sesh. If washing machine and drier are not working properly, you have to go laundromat every night after work. So it is fair to say that renting a room with available intercom, washing machine, and drier and without security guard is critical.</li>
<li>Competitiveness: When we just started in Rhodes in 2019, there were not many operations/girls compare to covid time. After covid, lockdown, shops closed, the town was flooded by working girls because of above reasons. We still could make decent money even though there were more competitors, because there are also more customers from Gladesville, Ryde, Eastwood, they had to release their sexual frustration in somewhere anyhow. Rhodes was densely populated and we left to WWP, Mascot, Parramatta, Olympic park or interstate cities. Which&hellip; we believe there were less shops, or girls but more customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wentworth point, Burwood and Parramatta were great too, Wolli creek ok, Mascot was meh City is the worst. City has several agencies up and running and they have many girls in their roster, which we find it rather competitive. Rooms are pricy in general too. Actually, girls can make same money but a booker need to work harder to get customers.</p>

</p>
<p>Oh, forgot to mention that CBD is dead when it&rsquo;s weekend&hellip;</p>
<p>We still find Rhodes the greatest after all because.. Working girls prefer young wealthy Chinese bois who rather shy(or can’t be bothered) to ask many positions or extra services and Rhodes has a lot of them. I’m just guessing…</p>
<p>As a booker, Rhodes, WWP, Burwood or any other places has little difference to none. Maybe Burwood no-show rate was slightly higher than others?</p>
