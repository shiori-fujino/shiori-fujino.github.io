My choice: Mongol cake that is made of cream cheese, condensed milk, and possibly&hellip; oreo powder?</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous post, I wasn’t Celine’s exclusive booker this time. Instead, I got to work with the other 3 people as a team. 2 of them are a couple, other is married so this team seem to much worried about my relationship and seggs life. 🥲 They are pushing me to date D. We saw D twice for somewhat reasons, and we&rsquo;ll probably seeing him once in a while from time to time in the future. I said “I think he’s hot” once… maybe twice and this lovely team act like I need to get married to him or something. At least a date.</p>
<p>D is not a customer either a sex-related industry person, to be specific, he has a pretty interesting career(can possess guns and can use them properly !!! and that&rsquo;s why I find him interesting maybe). I don’t think I will ever be able to lie about my previous job to my future boyfriend(s) though. I feel like I have to let them know about it. I’m scared to like someone who doesn’t know my past, What if I get to like him so much and he dumps my ass because of my past, I am worried and I will die alone lonely. 🥲 I don&rsquo;t even like cats. 🥲</p>
<hr>
<p>The first few days were not busy and I thought it’s our misinterpretation of the situation. This team used to do 70ish jobs a day same time last year. The team has a customer database based on area, so we prepared the place somewhere near that area. But… those nearby customers didn’t come.</p>
<p>2 weeks are actually… not too long. You can use your left hand in your bathroom or you can just hold it for better pleasure later. The news made a great fuss about fines and penalties that you can get during the lockdown and it scared people. People wouldn’t risk getting busted by police middle of the road… on the way to fuck&hellip; they won’t come&hellip; 🥲
The team did 70ish jobs last year because lockdown was longer. 2 weeks are short enough to make guys be a monk. 🥲  fkuc I should’ve been just relaxing at home, playing Animal crossing, not trying to cover lights with a pink post-it or teaching girls how to take mirror selfies.

But my assumption was wrong, I underestimated guys again. Our phones were on fire after 3 days. Guys could hold their horniness for 3 days maybe but no longer than that. The news was still wagging about the $1000 penalty and things but it shouldn’t be a matter for horny mammals. They don’t care anymore.</p>
<p>I was babysitting girls in a campsite whole last week, stuck in the study while they were getting rooted by a number of guys. The good thing is meds are getting wear off more and more and I finally want one nice warm seggs, and the bad thing is I couldn’t have it when I was finally horny. 🥲</p>
<p>Our second campsite was only 10km from Rhodes so I could ride up and down commuting. One very cold night, my hands and feet became frozen veggies but I liked it more than any other not-so-cold days. A quiet, empty city, the sky is dark but the road isn’t, nose and ears hurt from confronting cold wind… it reminds me of night snowy mountain, plus good playlist&hellip; oh so good!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using an AirPod since 2016. I and everyone around me expected that I’m gonna lose it within 3 months or shorter but I’m still using it surprisingly. I think it’s almost dead though, the battery doesn’t last longer than 30 minutes after it&rsquo;s fully charged. One of the not many things that I have and it worth the money: is AirPod. Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve been Apple&rsquo;s loyal fan-girl since 2005. I had uncountable apple products and this fucking shit Macbook Air 2020 is fucking so useless shithole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having my first day off in 8 days. I woke up late, ordered my favourite Malaysian veggie dish and char kway teow.</p>

<p>Next episode: My wrecked computer history, things that I don&rsquo;t understand from some girls. And next campsite.</p>
