        <p>I had few goals to achieve before 2020 ends.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix computers: I edited some system files (I think it was sudoer.d) from my desktop and laptop and now I can&rsquo;t use it at all. I went to Apple store today, though they can&rsquo;t help me either because I don&rsquo;t have a proof of purchase(receipt)&hellip;</li>
<li>Get motorbike checked up: Dashboard says to get serviced since late December.</li>
<li>Make a new blog</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to build a new blog since I closed my previous one. I was bored with WordPress. I wanted to try a new thing. I also found that there are many free options. (I was paying few hundred $$$ a year for WordPress business account. I spent money on no e-commerce, no other special features but merely writing weird, random shit.)</p>
<p>My first attempt for a new blog was Jekyll and failed because ruby on rails somehow didn&rsquo;t work well with my macs. I had to do something about echo $PATH  but never could work it out. Next, I had a look Gatsby, I have JS phobia so Next, I even tried to learn flask using python and gave up after lecture 5. database. SQLite hmm&hellip;? The most recent experiment was with Hugo(go lang), and I quite like it. Install, and configuration was smoother than others. This blog is made of hugo, and I&rsquo;m not paying at all.</p>
<p>I spent days and nights to find a perfect tool(Jekyll, Gatsby, Flask, Hugo) which never seems to exist. I spent more days and nights trying to fix here a little bit, and then there, a tiny bit&hellip; and it never ends. By the time I&rsquo;m already sick of what I&rsquo;m doing. And then I look into other options. That is how I spent my six months of long-break from writing. But I&rsquo;m giving up because I don&rsquo;t think I can ever start writing if I keep searching for an ideal framework.</p>
<p>People say that it is nearly impossible to become a master of something without 10,000 hours of practice. A year is 8760 hours, and it&rsquo;s my 10th anniversary. I have been working in the sex industry for ten years in 2021. A decade of dedication, devotion!!! This blog may not be the most aesthetical or high-tech portfolio filled with modern technology. But will be filled with something original and ingenious instead. From the latest specific market trend to an ethical contemplation about particular career&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, the moral of this story is: I still need to go procycles, st. peters and need to think about how I fix the apple disaster, but I finally made a new blog, and it took half a year at least. Big progress.</p>
