    <h3>Why Took So Long</h3>

    <div class="blog__content">
        <p>I had few goals to achieve before 2020 ends.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix computers: I edited some system files (I only remember sudoer.d) from my desktop and laptop and now I can&rsquo;t use it at all. I went to Apple store today, though they can&rsquo;t help me either because I don&rsquo;t have a proof of purchase(receipt)&hellip;</li>
<li>Get motorbike checked up: Dashboard says to get serviced since December.</li>
<li>Make a new blog</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to build a new blog from the time when I closed my previous one. I was bored with WordPress. I wanted to try a new thing. I also found that there are many free options. (I was paying few hundred $$$ a year for WordPress business account. no e-commerce, no other special features but merely for writing weird, random shit.)</p>
<p>My first attempt for a new blog was Jekyll and failed it because ruby on rails somehow didn&rsquo;t work well with my macs. I had to do something about echo $PATH  but never could work it out. Next, I had a look Gatsby, I have JS phobia so skip, Next. I even tried to learn flask using python and gave up after lecture 5. database. SQLite hmm&hellip;? The most recent experiment was with Hugo, and I quite like it. Install, and configuration was smoother than others. This blog is made of hugo, and I&rsquo;m not paying at all,.</p>
<p>I spent days and nights to find a perfect tool(Jekyll, Gatsby, Flask, Ghost, Next, Hexo, Hugo) which never seems to exist. After I chose the tool, I spent more days and nights trying to fix here a little bit, and then there a tiny bit&hellip; and it never ends. After spend day and night editing templates I was already sick of what I was doing. I forgot about actual blogging. And then I looked into other options because I wanted to write. That is how I spent my six months of long-break from writing. But I&rsquo;m giving up now because I don&rsquo;t think I can ever start writing if I keep searching for an ideal framework.</p>
<p>People say that it is nearly impossible to become a master of something without 10,000 hours of practice. A year is 8760 hours, and&hellip; it&rsquo;s my 10th anniversary. I have been working in the sex industry for ten years in 2021. A decade of dedication, devotion to sex work, This blog may not be the most aesthetical one filled with modern technology, but will be filled with something original and ingenious instead. From the latest brothel market trend to an ethical contemplation about prostitution&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply grateful to tech/IT bloggers because I could manage to build a new blog by myself with thieir time and effort. I hope someone can discover new idea and perspective through my experience and knowledge too. It&rsquo;s all in here.</p>
