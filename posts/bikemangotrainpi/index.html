        <p>Try to write something when my mood is ok.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pKXxrFo.jpg" alt="bye bye bike"></p>
<p>I rode my bike four more days without knowing that registration got expired. It reminds me of the glorious smart car and $1500 penalty for driving an unregistered vehicle. Rather, I was missing its good old days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m harking back to my past the most these days. I look up google location history(it&rsquo;s spookily accurate, have a look yours if you have time), I stare at 70GB iCloud albums filled with food, night out, people, places, and many more things. Things are different now; I took only two photos last month.</p>
<p>I had to do something to swing my mood. I couldn&rsquo;t wait until someone or something changes me. I wanted to sell my bike abruptly. Rego is expired, the brake lever is broken in half. The gear lever is crooked, and the dashboard is still showing the message that says it needs to get serviced&hellip; I put it on gumtree without any high expectation (peanut price), and voila, I sold my motorbike exactly a year after I bought it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d have more chances to have (very authentic)international food if you work at a brothel. Girls from all different countries hold their cooking contest every single day. When all is said and done, My favourite dish in a decade is green mango with chilli jam. A delectable green fruit, tangy, fragrant, crunch&hellip; with a kick from freshly made chilli sauce, mmm yum. Girls are the best; they know how to eat. Today I learnt that it&rsquo;s delicious to spread condensed milk on a croissant. Yum!</p>

<p>I like to hop on a train on Sunday night. On a weekday, public transport is packed with depressing 9 to 5 people. What about weekend daytime? It&rsquo;s overwhelmed by overly excited families and couples. Sunday night, on the other hand, is a bit easier. It&rsquo;s not tensed like a weekday, either hustle bustle like a weekend. &ldquo;Sunday night train individuals&rdquo; seem to have some kind of fellowship. We sympathize with each other; we loll around, but we don&rsquo;t disturb others because we all poor little thing who has work on Sunday.</p>

<p>I bought raspberry pi; I better put my energy into something when medications start to wear off. I can&rsquo;t stay as an apathetic potato forever, I have to do something. I remember it took a while to set up raspberry pi for the first time. Micro USB, just USB, USB type a, b, c, micro HDMI, HDMI, DVI and VGA sort of things all looked similar and complicated. Not only that, many other internal errors haunted me, and I was defeated. Surprisingly I only took a minute or two to set it all up this time, and I was at a loss what to do next. I wanted to solve some issues and errors, but they didn&rsquo;t exist. It finished too easy and quick, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say I liked it. What is this, am I addicted to struggle?</p>
