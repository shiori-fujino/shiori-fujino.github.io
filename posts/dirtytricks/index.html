				<p>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope it’s only a coincidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do.</li>
<li>No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems. I changed to below picture earlier this week and it’s not acceptable. Why</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone must be busy reporting things, or maybe just a coincidence and I am being delusional as usual.</p>
<p>My work ethic is simple. I don’t lie, steal, and do dodgy or dishonest things to win someone or make more money. Perhaps that’s why I never been able to win a prize or be the best at anything in my life. I never felt or thought like I want to win someone except when I did jiu-jitsu. (And I never got to win) Once upon a time&hellip; I was the only one who got a perfect score in the ‘society and culture’ subject and I still talk about it ㅋㅋㅋ that’s my only winning experience, no other than that.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this dog eats dog industry, not many people seem to have the same opinion as me. Betrayal, snitching, untruthful behaviour are such common and I don&rsquo;t even bother anymore. But fuck you stop reporting and live your life.</p>
<p>As a legal brothel, a shop only can make money by charging room rental fee to a service provider. For example, if you pay $250 for (K) Chrissy, Chrissy pays shop $30 for a room, not shop pays Chrissy $220. Brothel only renting out rooms to service providers so technically speaking, a shop has no responsibilities for whatever happens between girls and customers.</p>

<p>In my fucking dream ⭐</p>
<p>Realistically, customers these days have too many options. If you don&rsquo;t like No. 5, there are 39 other brothels in the inner city, 25 more in the inner west, 19 more in Parramatta and 8 more in both Liverpool City Council and in the City of Canterbury Bankstown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sex-in-the-suburbs-where-are-sydney-s-red-light-districts-20190621-p51zxr.html#:~:text=The">Sex in the suburbs: Where are Sydney&rsquo;s red light districts?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t care feedbacks because we are just renting a room, customer leave upset. Next time when they are horny, they can go one of other 83 brothels nearby. If customers go to other shop, girls will make less money. If girls make less money, girls will leave to one of many other shops. When there are less girls, customers have not many options to choose, so more customers will leave. and then girls will leave, and customers. and girls and then customers.</p>
<p>That is why I am trying my best to hear from customers. So we can improve, perform better, girls make good money, customer leave happy, everyone happy at the end of the day. While I am doing my best to make everyone happy and better together, someone is trying hardest to ruin other’s business because that’s the only way (s)he can be better than others, that’s pathetic.</p>
<p>I had to buy a new game because I am too lonely playing mario kart deluxe alone.</p>

Bought this because it was on sale. Looks scary, not going to play at night. Didn’t start to play so no score yet.</p>
