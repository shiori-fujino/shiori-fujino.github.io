		I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.

		Sex worker market 1st Generation - Walk the streets and pick up on the corner
2nd Generation - Internet
I was one of the beneficiaries of the 2nd generation sex worker industry. In the 2nd wave, consumers could share their experiences and thoughts with many more people through the magic of the internet (forums). Communicating with them through the discussion board and hanging out via social media worked great for me.

		It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&hellip;&rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.

		My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed. Very very smol bed.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, but I stopped seeing or hearing things.
