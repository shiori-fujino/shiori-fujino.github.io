      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of girls&#39; pictures and I have reached a conclusion that selfies can be more attractive than photos that were taken by another person, when it comes to sex worker&amp;rsquo;s profile pictures.
Of course, hiring a professional with a proper setting is different. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we use the same iPhone X as our only equipment.
   This, can&amp;rsquo;t be any worse. Apart from anything (cloth, shoes, angle, lighting etc) She just looks so awkward.</description>

      <description>Things you can do(other than sex) during lockdown
 Buy OneWheel and ride Send me invitation on Animal Crossing  I remember same time of last year, It was lockdown stage 4 and people were horny as usual. Maybe even hornier than ever. Restriction made people crazy, nothing to do so better have sex! Guys look for sex workers even during WW2 so&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about having blueballs, If there&amp;rsquo;s a will, there&amp;rsquo;s a way.</description>

      <description>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope itâ€™s only a coincidence.
 No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do. No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.
   Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>

      <description>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&amp;rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&amp;rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&amp;hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&amp;rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.</description>
