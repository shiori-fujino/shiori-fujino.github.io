      <description>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope itâ€™s only a coincidence.
 No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do. No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.

Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>

      <description>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&amp;rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&amp;rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&amp;hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&amp;rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.</description>
