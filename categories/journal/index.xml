      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been half a year after I wrote Medication journal (1) and the medication still is wearing off. I, at last, started the magic day of the month for the first time in 6 months, but I still lactate only ever so slightly when I squeeze my blueberries hard enough.
I stumbled upon watching a documentary1 and tv series2 about trauma recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge progress that I could finish an hour of documentary film and 10 episodes of tv series.</description>

      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed. Very very smol bed.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, but I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>
