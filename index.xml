      <description>Ok I did it again, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand with notion anymore even though it&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to maintain.
I want to make my blog
 fast no javescript, minimum lines of code fully functional still  Now kimchiest.com is 10 mb big and 9.6 mb are from media (picture) so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good :D
It still has darkmode but only works when your device is set to darkmode.</description>

      <description>City ride from Darling harbour through Barangaroo to Rocks and Circular quay. Fun 🤩
      Written in Korean 느지막이 일어나 세수도 안하고 마차 크로쌍 사러 갔다가 나간김에 장도 봐가지고 왔다. 주말 오후 쇼핑몰 졸라 싫음. ㅋㅋ 크로와상 정말이지 너무 맛있어 💕💓
   외로워서 죽을것 같은 시간에는 개미 한마리 없다가 혼자라도 재밌게 잘 살 수 있어 라고 마음이 조금 단단해 지면 그때 꼭 어디서 슬금슬금 기어들 나오더라 그럼 나는 또 맥도 못추고 사랑에 빠졌다.</description>

      <description>Recently, strange things are happening and I hope it’s only a coincidence.
 No. 5 WeChat was blocked 3 times in 4 weeks because we apparently violated user rules. We only did what other shops do. No. 5 website was taken down from google search result today because the landing page picture was exposing too much body part, We had a naked woman showing her titties pic on our first page last year and had zero problems.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.
   Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>

      <description>I want to punch people in their jaw sometimes, especially those cowards, keyboard warriors.
I was doing my work routine, checking reviews, update website and so on and I found out a customer calls out a working girl ugly only because she&amp;rsquo;s not his cup of tea whereas other people still think She&amp;rsquo;s cutiepie. I mean&amp;hellip; is it ok to describe a human as ugly?
Some people might think it&amp;rsquo;s ok because working girls are there to be judged.</description>

      <description>Shiori-fujino.com was getting too hot. Gloriously, I got a psycho stalker too for the first time in my life. I wrote about private escort work with Celine when there was level 4 lockdown going on, also about crazy bitch ass stalker hayabi666. I also tried to write new things like interviewing Aoi.
In the meantime, my mental health was going downhill. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I was getting delusional. I was even locked in psychward for 15 days because of these unexplainable delusional thoughts.</description>

      <description>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &amp;ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.</description>

      <description>I quit had a break from management position. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any more good girls, had a dull time with advertising and marketing, didn&amp;rsquo;t like new staff, and I thought it is a waste if I don&amp;rsquo;t work as a working girl when I&amp;rsquo;m still fresh.
I started my sex career at a relatively younger age. When I was Christmas at 5*(not No. 5) I was only early 20&amp;rsquo;s. As you know, the younger the better in this industry.</description>

      <description>I had to change or renew a domain after a year of having chelseastayshealthy.com. I was still healthy, spent most of my time doing yoga and I wrote about yoga a lot. I also wrote some behind stories of brothel management. Around this time, I could find good quality Korean girls and I wrote about them too. Also about the receptionist, I remember the title was like No. 5, the receptionist graveyard or something like that.</description>

      <description>This was my first domain which I started in 2015 with WordPress. I think I did Brazillian Jiujitsu, weight lift, and yoga at that time, and I thought stay healthy is the way of life.
I think my first few posts were about heart broken story. I got dumped by Korean boii and cried days and nights. After a while He found my teary post about him and left some comments, people made fun of him and I felt little sorry for him.</description>
