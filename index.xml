      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed, and 90 minutes of limited internet access time.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>

      <description>This notepad is made after many fails of other blog set-ups and many other failures in my life.
I had a blog that I used to write about sex, relationship and other personal issues. I ran for about 5 years and had to close it because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle too much attention. I started it to get attention, and I succeeded it. But it was too much for me.
Over half a year, I was locked-in psychward twice.</description>
