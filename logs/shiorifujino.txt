I ~~quit~~ had a break from management position. I couldn't get any more good girls, had a dull time with advertising and marketing, didn't like new staff, and I thought it is a waste if I don't work as a working girl when I'm still fresh. 

I started my sex career at a relatively younger age. When I was Christmas at 5*(not No. 5) I was only early 20's. As you know, the younger the better in this industry. Around 2018 I was still in my 20's and it is a very competitive age. But I didn't want to work in Sydney since I had many amazing ~~over-hyped~~ reviews from nice people. I could make money easier and quicker because of those reviews but at the same time, it gave me too much pressure. What if people book me because of all that hype and I disappoint them? I don't know what's this logic but there are too many options in Australia anyway. Many of my working friends go to other states to work and it wasn't difficult at all to find some places to work.

I went to Perth, this city is my favourite! I fall in love many times in many different places and I wrote about it. I went overseas for freediving, yoga, love many times and I wrote about it. I had freedom, youth, money, and a blog. Went to Brisbane and Melbourne as well, I caught a spy cam and I posted my first sex video on my blog. 

After wandering big time, I was back to a management position because I finally got an official boyfriend ~~again~~. People started complaining, whinging that I don't post as often as before. 

I didn't write much at this point because the boyfriend was in Melbourne and long-distance relationship bullshit gave me shit tons of headache. I wrote about it though, When I wrote about this long-distance relationship with Lebanese who self-claims that he is French, daily views were about **500-600**. Around this time, covid19 hit Australia and all over the world and people had nothing to do rather than reading a random blog. Readers were also from all over the place, Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Often times I got traffic from the US or some random European countries but I guess some were using nordVPN or something similar. lol **(I'm not sponsored by nordVPN)**

I put nude selfies and encouraged readers to donate to the writer. Only a few people did send me money through PayPal, I think I made less than $50. Lol Selfies were free to download anyway.
