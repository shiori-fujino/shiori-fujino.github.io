				<p>Shiori-fujino.com was getting too hot. Gloriously, I got a psycho stalker too for the first time in my life. I wrote about private escort work with <strong>Celine</strong> when there was level 4 lockdown going on, also about crazy bitch ass stalker <strong>hayabi666.</strong> I also tried to write new things like interviewing <strong>Aoi.</strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, my mental health was going downhill. I didn&rsquo;t know that I was getting delusional. I was even locked in psychward for 15 days because of these unexplainable delusional thoughts. I wrote about the psych-ward experience after I got released.</p>
<p>Even under medication though, I couldn&rsquo;t trust anyone especially if they are from the internet or my blog. I was very conscious about my blog. I chose to close my blog and deleted all data. My posts, my pics, and videos. That seemed to be helpful.</p>
<p>To delete the whole big ass data nourishing blog, I had to talk with WordPress. They asked me many times if I really want to delete it, they also suggested to back up in case I want to write again. I didn&rsquo;t do anything because I was very delusional. I just hated everything, not only the blog but my life too. But the blog was my life anyway.</p>
<p>And next day, instant regret. lol</p>
<p>I had many hobbies, from Brazillian jiujitsu, yoga, cycling, to freediving, etc but none of those lasted more than a year or two. On the other hand, I wrote and maintain my blog for over 5 years.</p>

<p>But it is what it is, I dealt with it.</p>
<p>Time passed, covid gone, road got busier, back to work, everything back to normal. I stopped medication without discussing it with a doctor because I seemed very normal <del>from my point of view.</del> I started getting delusional again. Long story short, I got locked in psychward once again. lol</p>
<p>This time, they gave me a shot rather than pills to avoid situations like I stop taking medication freely without the doctor&rsquo;s indication. And it was very very seriously horrendously mother fucking horrible. 😰</p>
<p>They had to stop delusional thoughts, so they stop me to think. I couldn&rsquo;t feel/think anything under that one shot. It&rsquo;s hard to explain but imagine you have nothing in your brain so you can&rsquo;t feel/think anything.</p>

<p>I was SUPER suicidal. I couldn&rsquo;t even do very basic things such as washing dishes and having a shower. I had to find a thing that motivates me and I thought it is writing. I was super poor as well, couldn&rsquo;t afford WordPress. I didn&rsquo;t want to anyway. I wanted to make a thing from scratch so it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m doing something. I used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and GitHub, made shiori-fujino.github.io</p>
<p>I think it helped a lot. I spent time on something that I like and I tried to express my feeling and thoughts as much as I could even though my brain refused to do. I don&rsquo;t know how many views a day and it didn&rsquo;t matter. The site is down now but you can still read posts from:</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it though, it&rsquo;s depressing.</p>
