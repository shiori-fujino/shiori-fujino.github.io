				<p>I had to change or renew a domain after a year of having chelseastayshealthy.com. I was still healthy, spent most of my time doing yoga and I wrote about yoga a lot. I also wrote some behind stories of brothel management. Around this time, I could find good quality Korean girls and I wrote about them too. Also about the receptionist, I remember the title was like <em>No. 5, the receptionist graveyard</em> or something like that. I wrote a sex review with random guys, as well as a review of stone dildo. I didn&rsquo;t like it because I had to warm it up before use.</p>
<p>Good old days! Daily views were getting higher, WordPress kept sending me push alarm that I hit the highest record of daily view and It was rewarding. I was working for 42 and 5 at the same time, random people started to say hello to me when they come to shop. They told me they&rsquo;re enjoying my blog. Some people even sent me sweets, flowers, and other presents. I am still using some of those gifts very well. I have met many new people and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I think I had war with Lenka_x5 around this time? No. 5 was under renovation? We had only 6 rooms that time. Once I called some Korean girls in other shop as <em>leftover kimchi fried rice</em> and people accused me so bad. pfttt</p>
