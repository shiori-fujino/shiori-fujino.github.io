				<p>This was my first domain which I started in 2015 with WordPress. I think I did Brazillian Jiujitsu, weight lift, and yoga at that time, and I thought stay healthy is the way of life.</p>
<p>I think my first few posts were about heart broken story. I got dumped by Korean boii and cried days and nights. After a while He found my teary post about him and left some comments, people made fun of him and I felt little sorry for him. He kept trying to reach out to me until 2019, sad boii.</p>
<p>Daily views were under 100 and readers were Sydney punters only. I was once freaked out because there was traffic from Korea, because I didn&rsquo;t want any friends or family find out my very sexual blog. One guy confessed that it was him 5 years later in 2020. He was just travelling Korea. keke</p>
<p>I wrote about my daddy issue, attention seeking issue, low self-esteem problem and many other issues. It was good tool to look into myself, and I learnt a lot of myself from writing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see my dad until this time and I finally decided to contact my dad first after I wrote about dad. Good move.</p>
