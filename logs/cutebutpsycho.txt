I had to change or renew a domain after a year of having chelseastayshealthy.com. I was still healthy, spent most of my time doing yoga and I wrote about yoga a lot. I also wrote some behind stories of brothel management. Around this time, I could find good quality Korean girls and I wrote about them too. Also about the receptionist, I remember the title was like *No. 5: the receptionist graveyard* or something like that. I wrote a sex review with random guys, as well as a review of stone dildo. I didn't like it because I had to warm it up before use.  

Good old days! Daily views were getting higher, WordPress kept sending me push alarm that I hit the highest record of daily view and It was rewarding. I was working for 42 and 5 at the same time, random people started to say hello to me when they come to shop. They told me they're enjoying my blog. Some people even sent me sweets, flowers, and other presents. I am still using some of those gifts very well. I have met many new people and it was a lot of fun.

I think I had war with Lenka_x5 around this time? No. 5 was under renovation? We had only 6 rooms that time. Once I called some Korean girls in other shop as *leftover kimchi fried rice* and people accused me so bad. pfttt
