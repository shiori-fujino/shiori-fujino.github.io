      <description>City ride from Darling harbour through Barangaroo to Rocks and Circular quay. Fun 🤩
      Written in Korean 느지막이 일어나 세수도 안하고 마차 크로쌍 사러 갔다가 나간김에 장도 봐가지고 왔다. 주말 오후 쇼핑몰 졸라 싫음. ㅋㅋ 크로와상 정말이지 너무 맛있어 💕💓
   외로워서 죽을것 같은 시간에는 개미 한마리 없다가 혼자라도 재밌게 잘 살 수 있어 라고 마음이 조금 단단해 지면 그때 꼭 어디서 슬금슬금 기어들 나오더라 그럼 나는 또 맥도 못추고 사랑에 빠졌다.</description>

      <description>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &amp;ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.</description>
