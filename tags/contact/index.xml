      <description>Things you can do(other than sex) during lockdown
Buy OneWheel and ride Send me an invitation on Animal Crossing I remember same time of last year, It was lockdown stage 4 though people were horny as usual. Maybe even hornier than ever. Restriction made people crazy, nothing to do so better have sex! Guys looked for sex workers even during WW2 so… don’t worry too much about having blueballs, If there’s a will, there’s a way.</description>
