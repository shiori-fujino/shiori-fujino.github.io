      <description>Hi,
I am currently working at a brothel as a management. I do everything. I advertise, clean offices, help other staff, deliver food for girls, take picture of girls, write this… But I used to be a working girl, service provider too.
I’ve seen it and done it all, so not much surprises me these days. But when I first started, I used to be curious about this industry. Is it like in the movies?</description>
