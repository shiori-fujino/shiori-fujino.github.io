      <description>My first schizo episode was July 2020, and I had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks.
It was ok. Fun people around, interesting activities, free meals and snacks, could order uber-eats sometimes, visitors brought me a lot of sweets. The only problem was a single bed. Very very smol bed.
I start my antipsychotic drug journey with Olanzapine. It was great. Although I slept 20 hours a day, I was zombie-like while awake, but I stopped seeing or hearing things.</description>
