      <description>I just finished bootcamp in a Mongolian town.
   Have you ever seen Mongol Shop
   Mongol foods (and kimchi?)
   Mongol desserts
   Mongol&amp;hellip; fried dough?
   Mongol coffee (?)
   Mongol bags
   My choice: Mongol cake that is made of cream cheese, condensed milk, and possibly&amp;hellip; oreo powder?
As I mentioned in the previous post, I wasn’t Celine’s exclusive booker this time.</description>

      <description>Hello diabetes&amp;hellip; Machi machi Rhodes finally opened last week.
   Bengong is still my number one for brown sugar pearl milk tea though I like machi machi&amp;rsquo;s panna cotta series too. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 bottles of it when machi just opened at Sydney city, I was displeased at first but I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worth to wait after I had a sip. lol
   Not only Bengong&amp;rsquo;s and Machi-machi, there are some good eats in Rhodes:</description>
