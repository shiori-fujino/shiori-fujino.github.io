      <description>It has been a year after I refused to write. People still mention about my blog, even people who never knew about it started asking me, &amp;ldquo;I heard that you had a blog before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Blogging was fun, The funniest part was that it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m worthwhile. It is fascinating that someone spends their own time to read my stories. Some of them even try to interact with me because they find me interesting from what I write.</description>
